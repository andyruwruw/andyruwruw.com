# How it's Made

### Framework

This project was made using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). While most of my projects are in Vue.js, I figured I'd make this site using React.

### Graphics

The images were purchased from [craftwork.design](https://craftwork.design/)! They have some pretty solid sets.

The illustrations were provided in multiple formats, including Adobe Illustrator files. I separated the graphics into the layers, and rendered them as a SVG. From there it was just a matter of animating the separate layers.

### Tilt and Scroll

After going through quite a few libraries, I finally settled on [scroll-snap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scroll-snap) for scroll control and [react-parallax-tilt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-parallax-tilt) to move the SVG layers as the user moved the mouse.
